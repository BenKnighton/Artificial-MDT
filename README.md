### Everything you have ever read, heard, and seen is now organised and available.

Imagine you could learn anything, never be wrong again, retrieve the perfect memory, un-tainted by the wariness of cells clogged up in the back of your mind. Everyone remembers everything. Asking the right questions about something you vaguely remember used to not give you anything at all, but now suddenly, it all falls into place, and you will be able to recall anything.

The more you use this program, the more you start to learn what the right questions are to ask, and the more right questions you ask the more you’re going to be able to remember everything.

Over time you’re going to be able to remember everything about everything. This is the link, between making that small effort to remember, and actually receiving that memory with perfect clarity.

### It’s the ultimate organisation tool.

To use the Search bar in the searchers, you first type the keyword or phrase, or however may you want, separated by a comma. Once your keywords and phrases are ready, you begin you search. If the results come back empty, you can change the domains in the yellow box, which add synonyms to your search.

Spell check puts brackets around mis-spelled words, which then need to me removed. They are just to indicate what was changed of your search has lots of commas. If the results are too many, you can create a folder to inspect each one individually. Else, you can open all the results, or the first x amount, x being the number in the little counter next to the open files button.
The Artificial_Memory folder is where folders of images or YouTube playlists go.
