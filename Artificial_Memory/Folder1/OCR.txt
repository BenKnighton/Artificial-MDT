PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SECONDARY EMISSION 10.1a. Energy Distribution of the Secondaries If primary electrons of energy Eno strike the surface of a solid, the emitted electrons consist of three groups (Fig. 10.1): 1. Slow secondaries with energies NIE)I less than about 20 volts. These electrons are called true secondaries. Usually the energy distribution of these slow electrons has a maximum at an energy of a few electron volts: the exact Ego value may depend somewhat on the target used as a secondary emitter. The distribution can be roughly approximated by a Maxwellian energy dis- Fig. 10.1. Energy distribution of secondary electrons. The peak at low energies is due to true secondaries; the peak at E ~ Epo is due to reflected electrons. tribution, AN = CEV? exp (- - É) SE (10.1) In a Maxwellian energy distribution of particles at a temperature T., one would have E. = KI.; since E. is of the order of a few electron volts, the slow electrons can be considered as having a Maxwellian velocity distribution at an equivalent temperature of roughly 50,000°K. It is interesting to note that for metals the distribution (10.1) is independent of the primary energy, whereas there are indications that in some insulators the relative number of low-energy true secondaries increases with increasing primary energy. 2. Electrons of intermediate energies. This group is partly made up of primary electrons that have lost large amounts of energy and partly of lattice electrons that have gained a large amount of energy in a collision with a primary electron. It is impossible to discriminate between these possibilities. The group is usually so small that it is of little practical importance. 3. Back-scattered primaries, with energies close to the primary energy Epo (for example, E > #Em); their energy distribution has a sharp maximum for E = Ep (reflected electrons. It is common practice to introduce the reflection coefficient or back-scattering coefficient @. which is defined as See 101 / Physical Characieristics of Secondary Emission 189 total number of back-scattered primaries a = total number of incident primaries The quantity a increases with increasing atomic number Z Of the atoms There target; its value is rather mall for the light dements and inertons in thalue of about 0150 ages with increase b at tjet primary energies. toe quantity a also increases with increasing primary energy, reaching en Tymptolio value for Eno > 100 kv.

O Besides the velocity distribution it is also important to know the angular distribution of the slow secondaries. The best experiments give approxi mately a cosine distribution; this means that the number of emitted secondaries per second emitted in the solid angle formed by two cones of angles Aand 0 + A0 with their axes perpendicular to the surface is (Fig. 10.2) AN = NP(0) AO = N COS A AA (10.2) where N is the number of secondary electrons emitted per second Primary electrons PIA)I дА Vacuum metal (a) (b) Fig. 10.2.

The threshold energy for ++ y creation is close to that for cc production which was discovered essentially simultaneously causing great excitement. The t decays necessarily to a v plus a virtual W boson which may decay to a quark plus antiquark or to a lepton plus antilepton. Since the vy from the t~ decay and i from the r* decay are essentially invisible, energy and momentum in the collision appear lost. If the W - decays to du, hadrons may be observed, e.g. ete→tto→ i,atu,l → Dootsuce De. (1.130) The heavy c-quark decays necessarily to a virtual W+ plus an s-quark or d-quark (principally the s-quark because |V CKM| < < |V CKM1) and a leptonic decay such as W+ -> et ve can also result in missing energy plus hadrons, e.g. eter -> C§ -> sW+sW- -> sudse De -+ RaKise ve. (1.131) The discovery of ++ t production was based on events of the form (1.132) in which both the virtual W- and W+ decay to lepton plus anti-lepton leading to charged leptons in association with missing energy and without additional hadrons. Figure 1.13 illustrates one of the first + t heavy lepton pairs events identified. The t is an integral charge spin 1/2 fermion without strong interactions which can Fe Wire hits é collision point e Er= 113 FIGURE 1.13 Early + + r production event. A candidate for eté -> + t is visualized. Decays such as t- -> e V+ Ve lead to detectable e* u F pairs plus invisible neutrinos. In this event, a muon moves upwards leaving ionization hits in a central cylindrical wire chamber. It deposits a small amount of energy in an external electromagnetic calorimeter and passes through steel plates leaving additional hits in interleaved wire chambers. An electron heads downwards and creates a shower of particles, its energy contained in the calorimeter. Tafter Martin L. Perl, SLAC-PUB-10150]
